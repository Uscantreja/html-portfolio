<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Jared.</p>

<p>Here are just a few things about me.</p>

<h3>Things that I do and love:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>I am currently a residential electrician.</li>
  <li>I love Bjj and have been doing it for years!</li>
<li>I love expanding my skill sets.</li>
<li>I love the idea of expanding my carrer choices and trying new things!</li>
<li>So far, I am REALLY enjoying this programming stuff and I think it will be something I will do for the rest of my life!</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h3>Things that I do not enjoy:</h3>
<ol>
<li>I do not enjoy the summer, It gets way too hot. I much rather the fall season!</li>
<li>I do not like desserts, dont ask me why. They are just not my favorite.</li>
<li>I do not like stress and anxiety, so I always try to find my happy place in tough situations. It seems to work most of the time (I am sure thats how everybody is). </li>
<li>I am not a big party person. I would much rather learn new skills on the weekends then go and party.</li>
<li>And finally, I do not like sitting and doing nothing. I always have to be doing something. Whether it is physical or learning.</li></ol>
