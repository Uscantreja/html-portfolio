<h1>Jared's Top 3 Movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Karate Kid</h3>
<p>Gives me a great 80's feel. Plus martial arts are involved.</p>
<h3>Grease</h3>
<p>The original High school musical. </p>
<h3>Sound of Freedom</h3>
<p>Brings awareness to a huge issue the world faces today. This actually may be my favorite movie currently.</p>
